                submission, acceptance, review of the revised submission and
                camera-ready submission. The Editorial Board has decided to
                implement desk review and rejection by the editorial board. On
                scrutinizing the papers by the editorial board, if the papers
                are rejected in the process of desk review, that will not assign
                any review further. All submissions will be screened for
                plagiarism by iThenticateR or Turnitin, and when identified, the
                submissions by the same author will be rejected at any stage of
                the conference even after the conference and after the
                publication of the proceedings online from the CRC. The question

                be made in the third person in the text description of the
